# Format Parsing

> Formats are only available in Downlink 0.3+

Formats provide an additional (optional) way to differentiate releases. This can be especially helpful when the same version, platform and architecture are available as both an installer and tarball, for example.

When a specific format is not requested, storage backends should behave basically the same as before.
