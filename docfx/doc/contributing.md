# Contributing Guide

This is very much an active project so any and all contributions are welcome, even just finding issues!

## Reporting issues

All issues should be tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/agc93/downlink), with enough information to reproduce the issue.

## Code Contributions

This repository is based around the Git Flow workflow, using feature branches and pull requests to manage incoming changes and fixes. Generally speaking, the process can be summarised as follows:

- Find a change or fix you want to implement
- Fork the repo
- Create a new branch named `feature/<your-feature-name>` and make your changes
- Open a PR from your feature branch against the `develop` branch (include the GitHub issue number for fixes)
- Success! I will provide feedback if needed, or just accept the changes directly and they should appear in the next release

## Documentation

This documentation should include an *Improve this Doc* button in the upper right. Click it to quickly jump to the source of the current documentation. You can then fork, branch and issue a PR just as with code contributions (see above).
